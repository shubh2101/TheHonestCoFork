                    The historical reliance on manual inputs and predictions for
                    route planning in the logistics sector has been a familiar
                    sight. Yet, today, the transportation industry is undergoing
                    a rapid evolution, driven by the compelling need for more
                    efficient, data-driven solutions. In a manner akin to how
                    multi-channel ecommerce software enhances customer
                    experiences, AI and ML are paving the way for transformative
                    changes in fleet management.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    AI and ML models offer a departure from the traditional
                    approaches, introducing real-time data analysis and pattern
                    recognition for instantaneous and accurate decision-making.
                    These technologies draw inspiration from the urgency that
                    businesses exhibit in adopting solutions like inventory
                    management system software to streamline operations and
                    adapt to ever-changing demands. With AI and ML, the
