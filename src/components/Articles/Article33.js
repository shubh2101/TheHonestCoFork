                    paper-based systems, and standalone scheduling software.
                    These methods can be inefficient, prone to errors, and
                    time-consuming. Common challenges include:

                  <p className="light-article-content mb-0">
                    No-shows and late arrivals are persistent challenges in
                    healthcare settings. They disrupt the flow of daily
                    operations, leading to wasted time, increased wait times for
                    other patients, and potential revenue loss. Moreover, these
                    issues can negatively impact patient care continuity and
                    overall experience. Addressing these challenges requires a
                    proactive and efficient approach, which is where PRM
                    software comes into play. One of the primary features of PRM
                    software is its ability to send automated appointment
                    reminders. These reminders can be delivered via various
                    channels, including email, SMS, and phone calls, ensuring
                    patients receive timely notifications. By providing multiple
                    touchpoints, PRM software increases the likelihood that
                    patients will remember their appointments and arrive on
                    time.
